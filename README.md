# Hotel Management System

## Overview

Hotel Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application developed using Swing and AWT for the user interface. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and leverages Java collections and exception handling to ensure robust and efficient operations. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for data storage, providing flexibility and scalability.

## Features

### User Roles

1. **Manager**
   - Created by default upon program initialization.
   - Manages guest and receptionist accounts.
   - Can add, delete, and modify guest and receptionist details.
   - Can manage room information (add, update).
2. **Receptionist**

   - Can be added by the manager.
   - Manages reservations.
   - Also manages guest accounts.

3. **Guest**
   - Can sign up for an account.
   - Can make and manage reservations.

### Authentication

- All users (manager, receptionist, guest) must sign in to access their respective functionalities.
- Passwords are encrypted in the database for security.
- Password recovery involves sending a reset code to the user's personal email.

### Data Management

- Uses MongoDB to store user details and hotel data.
- Manager-created receptionist accounts have an automatically generated hotel email and initial password.
